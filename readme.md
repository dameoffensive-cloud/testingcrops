## ✨ What’s New / Different in This Fork

Compared to the original planner, this version adds:

- **Location-aware planning**
  - Main Farm, Greenhouse, and Ginger Island are treated as distinct locations
  - Crops and harvests visually indicate *where* they are planted
- **Unified calendar view**
  - View all locations together or filter by location
- **Harvest location indicators**
  - Harvests now display the same farm/greenhouse/island markers as plantings
- **Updated 1.6 data**
  - Crops, events, and mechanics updated to match Stardew Valley v1.6
- **UI and usability improvements**
  - Cleaner modal layouts
  - Consistent icon sizing
  - Improved visual alignment and readability

The goal of this fork is to remain **visually familiar** while being **mechanically current** and more informative.

## 🧭 How to Use

1. **Select a date** on the calendar  
   Click any day to open the planting/harvesting planner for that date.

2. **Add a crop**
   - Choose the crop
   - Set the amount
   - Select the location (Farm, Greenhouse, or Ginger Island)
   - Optional: fertilizer, irrigation (where applicable)

3. **Use Auto-Plant**
   - Auto-Plant will automatically replant crops on their harvest day when possible
   - Useful for repeatable crops and long planning windows

4. **Switch views**
   - Use the top-left view button to cycle between:
     - All Farms
     - Main Farm only
     - Greenhouse only
     - Ginger Island only
   - This affects visibility, not where crops are planted

5. **Read the calendar**
   - Seed icons show planting days
   - Harvest icons show harvest days
   - Location badges (F / G / I) indicate *where* each crop or harvest occurs
   - Daily gold totals reflect planting costs and harvest revenue

This tool is meant for **planning and comparison**, not perfect simulation.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

This planner intentionally prioritizes clarity over absolute simulation accuracy.

Some known limitations include:

- **Modded crops and content**
  - Mods are not supported unless manually added to the data files
- **Future updates**
  - Stardew Valley updates may introduce mechanics not yet reflected here

If something looks wrong, it’s probably wrong, so feedback is always welcome.
